# surfs_up
Analyze weather on the island Oahu, Hawaii for a prospective start-up, a surf and ice cream shop.

## Project Overview

1. Using SQLite and SQLAlchemy, calculate the statistics on the precipitation and temperature from 01/01/2016 to 12/31/2017 on Oahu, Hawaii. 

  - Find all the stations in order to find the most active station for best results of statistics.

2. Using Pandas, create a dataframe of weather analysis to organize the results, making it easier to read.  

3. Using Matplotlib style fivethirtyeight, visualize the weather analysis results.

  - Preciptation Graph

4. Create an app using Flask to display the output of the weather statistics to webpages for easy reviewing by W.Avy and the Board of Directors.
